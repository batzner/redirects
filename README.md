# redirects

Website redirecting mobile users to App Store / Play Store pages. 

Intended for use in an app, where a "Recommend this app to a friend" button links to `index.html?app=name`. The website looks up the app name, searches for iOS / Android in the user agent and redirects to the corresponding App Store / Play Store page.

Visit [batzner.github.io/redirects?app=eurocycle](https://batzner.github.io/redirects?app=eurocycle) to see this in action.
